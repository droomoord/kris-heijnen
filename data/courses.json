    "description": "I learned about Vue directives, components, data binding, front-end routing. Basically all the things i learned in React, but in a different form. The best aspect of Vue I think is the usage of directives, which makes your code clean and readable (whereas in React you use JSX, it can get messy)."

I learned about Server Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and Incremental Static Site Regeneration (ISSR). I found out that Next.js is really SEO-friendly. You can even write back-end express-like API routes with Next. It's like building a front-end and back-end application in one framework!"
