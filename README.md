This is my developer **portfolio** website.

It's a Next.JS project (generated by create-next-app). There's only one page in the pages folder (index.js), so I don't use the out-of-the-box page rendering that comes with Next.JS. Still, I found it to be a better option than 'normal' React since the initial page load is an HTML file that can be modified to optimize SEO.

Run 'npm run dev' to start the development server.

It's deployed on [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
